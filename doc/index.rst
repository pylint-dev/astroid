Welcome to astroid's documentation!
===================================

**astroid** is a library for AST parsing, static analysis and inference,
currently powering most of **pylint** capabilities.

It offers support for parsing Python source code into ASTs, similar to how
the builtin **ast** module works. On top of that, it can partially infer various
Python constructs, as seen in the following example::

   from astroid import parse
   module = parse('''
   def func(first, second):
       return first + second

   arg_1 = 2
   arg_2 = 3
   func(arg_1, arg_2)
   ''')
   >>> module.body[-1]
   <Expr l.3 at 0x10ab46f28>
   >>> inferred = next(module.body[-1].value.infer())
   >>> inferred
   <Const.int l.None at 0x10ab00588>
   >>> inferred.value
   5


**astroid** also allows the user to write various inference transforms for
enhancing its Python understanding, helping as well **pylint** in the process
of figuring out the dynamic nature of Python.
