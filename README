ASTNG
=====

What's this ?
-------------

The aim of this module is to provide a common base representation of
python source code for projects such as pychecker, pyreverse,
pylint... Well, actually the development of this library is essentially
governed by pylint's needs.

Since 0.18, it provides a compatible representation which may come
from the `compiler` module (for python <= 2.4) pr the `_ast` module
(for python >= 2.5).

It extends bare node classes with some additional methods and
attributes. Instance attributes are added by a builder object, which
can generate extended ast (let's call them astng ;) by visiting either
an existent ast tree or by inspecting living object. Methods are added
by monkey patching ast classes. Finally some support for static
inference is provided.

Main modules are:

* `nodes` and `scoped_nodes` for more information about methods and
  attributes added to different node classes

* the `manager` contains a high level object to get astng trees from
  source files and living objects. It maintains a cache of previously
  constructed tree for quick access
