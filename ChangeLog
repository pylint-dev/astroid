  Closes #817


What's New in astroid 2.11.0?
=============================
Release date: 2022-03-12

* Add new (optional) ``doc_node`` attribute to ``nodes.Module``, ``nodes.ClassDef``,
  and ``nodes.FunctionDef``.

* Accessing the ``doc`` attribute of ``nodes.Module``, ``nodes.ClassDef``, and
  ``nodes.FunctionDef`` has been deprecated in favour of the ``doc_node`` attribute.
  Note: ``doc_node`` is an (optional) ``nodes.Const`` whereas ``doc`` was an (optional) ``str``.

* Passing the ``doc`` argument to the ``__init__`` of ``nodes.Module``, ``nodes.ClassDef``,
  and ``nodes.FunctionDef`` has been deprecated in favour of the ``postinit`` ``doc_node`` attribute.
  Note: ``doc_node`` is an (optional) ``nodes.Const`` whereas ``doc`` was an (optional) ``str``.

* Replace custom ``cachedproperty`` with ``functools.cached_property`` and deprecate it
  for Python 3.8+.

  Closes #1410

* Set ``end_lineno`` and ``end_col_offset`` attributes to ``None`` for all nodes
  with PyPy 3.8. PyPy 3.8 assigns these attributes inconsistently which could lead
  to unexpected errors. Overwriting them with ``None`` will cause a fallback
  to the already supported way of PyPy 3.7.

* Add missing ``shape`` parameter to numpy ``zeros_like``, ``ones_like``,
  and ``full_like`` methods.

  Closes PyCQA/pylint#5871

* Only pin ``wrapt`` on the major version.


What's New in astroid 2.10.0?
=============================
Release date: 2022-02-27


* Fixed inference of ``self`` in binary operations in which ``self``
  is part of a list or tuple.

  Closes PyCQA/pylint#4826

* Fixed builtin inference on `property` calls not calling the `postinit` of the new node, which
  resulted in instance arguments missing on these nodes.

* Fixed a crash on ``Super.getattr`` when the attribute was previously uninferable due to a cache
  limit size. This limit can be hit when the inheritance pattern of a class (and therefore of the
  ``__init__`` attribute) is very large.

  Closes PyCQA/pylint#5679

* Include names of keyword-only arguments in ``astroid.scoped_nodes.Lambda.argnames``.

  Closes PyCQA/pylint#5771

* Fixed a crash inferring on a ``NewType`` named with an f-string.

  Closes PyCQA/pylint#5770

* Add support for [attrs v21.3.0](https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/releases/tag/21.3.0) which
  added a new `attrs` module alongside the existing `attr`.

  Closes #1330

* Use the ``end_lineno`` attribute for the ``NodeNG.tolineno`` property
  when it is available.

  Closes #1350

* Add ``is_dataclass`` attribute to ``ClassDef`` nodes.

* Use ``sysconfig`` instead of ``distutils`` to determine the location of
  python stdlib files and packages.

  Related pull requests: #1322, #1323, #1324
  Closes #1282
  Ref #1103

* Fixed crash with recursion error for inference of class attributes that referenced
  the class itself.

  Closes PyCQA/pylint#5408

* Fixed crash when trying to infer ``items()`` on the ``__dict__``
  attribute of an imported module.

  Closes #1085

* Add optional ``NodeNG.position`` attribute.
  Used for block nodes to highlight position of keyword(s) and name
  in cases where the AST doesn't provide good enough positional information.
  E.g. ``nodes.ClassDef``, ``nodes.FunctionDef``.

* Fix ``ClassDef.fromlineno``. For Python < 3.8 the ``lineno`` attribute includes decorators.
  ``fromlineno`` should return the line of the ``class`` statement itself.

* Performance improvements. Only run expensive decorator functions when
  non-default Deprecation warnings are enabled, eg. during a Pytest run.

  Closes #1383


What's New in astroid 2.9.3?
============================
Release date: 2022-01-09

* Fixed regression where packages without a ``__init__.py`` file were
  not recognized or imported correctly.

  Closes #1327

What's New in astroid 2.9.2?
============================
Release date: 2022-01-04

* Fixed regression in ``astroid.scoped_nodes`` where ``_is_metaclass``
  was not accessible anymore.

Closes #1325

What's New in astroid 2.9.1?
============================
Release date: 2021-12-31

* ``NodeNG.frame()`` and ``NodeNG.statement()`` will start raising ``ParentMissingError``
  instead of ``AttributeError`` in astroid 3.0. This behaviour can already be triggered
  by passing ``future=True`` to a ``frame()`` or ``statement()`` call.

* Prefer the module loader get_source() method in AstroidBuilder's
  module_build() when possible to avoid assumptions about source
  code being available on a filesystem.  Otherwise the source cannot
  be found and application behavior changes when running within an
  embedded hermetic interpreter environment (pyoxidizer, etc.).

* Require Python 3.6.2 to use astroid.

* Removed custom ``distutils`` handling for resolving paths to submodules.

  Ref #1321

* Restore custom ``distutils`` handling for resolving paths to submodules.

  Closes PyCQA/pylint#5645

* Fix crash if a variable named ``type`` is accessed with an index operator (``[]``)
  in a generator expression.

  Closes PyCQA/pylint#5461

* Enable inference of dataclass import from marshmallow_dataclass.
  This allows the dataclasses brain to recognize dataclasses annotated by marshmallow_dataclass.

* Resolve symlinks in the import path
  Fixes inference error when the import path includes symlinks (e.g. Python
  installed on macOS via Homebrew).

  Closes #823
  Closes PyCQA/pylint#3499
  Closes PyCQA/pylint#4302
  Closes PyCQA/pylint#4798
  Closes PyCQA/pylint#5081

What's New in astroid 2.8.4?
============================
Release date: 2021-10-25

* Fix the ``scope()`` and ``frame()`` methods of ``NamedExpr`` nodes.
  When these nodes occur in ``Arguments``, ``Keyword``  or ``Comprehension`` nodes these
  methods now correctly point to the outer-scope of the ``FunctionDef``,
  ``ClassDef``, or ``Comprehension``.

* Fix the ``set_local`` function for ``NamedExpr`` nodes.
  When these nodes occur in ``Arguments``, ``Keyword``, or ``Comprehension`` nodes these
  nodes are now correctly added to the locals of the ``FunctionDef``,
  ``ClassDef``, or ``Comprehension``.

  be removed in 3.0.0. They are complex meta-inference functions that are better
  suited for pylint. Import them from ``pylint.checkers.utils`` instead
  (requires pylint ``2.12``).

Release date: 2021-08-20

* ``BaseContainer`` is now public, and will replace ``_BaseContainer`` completely in astroid 3.0.
* The call cache used by inference functions produced by ``inference_tip``
  can now be cleared via ``clear_inference_tip_cache``.

  attributes

  Closes PyCQA/pylint#1932
  Closes PyCQA/pylint#2062

* Removed ``Repr``, ``Exec``, and ``Print`` nodes as the ``ast`` nodes
  they represented have been removed with the change to Python 3

* Deprecate ``Ellipsis`` node. It will be removed with the next minor release.
  Checkers that already support Python 3.8+ work without issues. It's only
  necessary to remove all references to the ``astroid.Ellipsis`` node.
  This changes will make development of checkers easier as the resulting tree for Ellipsis
  will no longer depend on the python version. **Background**: With Python 3.8 the
  ``ast.Ellipsis`` node, along with ``ast.Str``, ``ast.Bytes``, ``ast.Num``,
  and ``ast.NamedConstant`` were merged into ``ast.Constant``.

* Deprecated ``Index`` and ``ExtSlice`` nodes. They will be removed with the
  next minor release. Both are now part of the ``Subscript`` node.
  Checkers that already support Python 3.9+ work without issues.
  It's only necessary to remove all references to the ``astroid.Index`` and
  ``astroid.ExtSlice`` nodes. This change will make development of checkers
  easier as the resulting tree for ``ast.Subscript`` nodes will no longer
  depend on the python version. **Background**: With Python 3.9 ``ast.Index``
  and ``ast.ExtSlice`` were merged into the ``ast.Subscript`` node.

* Updated all Match nodes to be internally consistent.

* Added inference tip for ``typing.Tuple`` alias

* Fix crash when evaluating ``typing.NamedTuple``

  Closes PyCQA/pylint#4383

* COPYING was removed in favor of COPYING.LESSER and the latter was renamed to LICENSE to make more apparent
  that the code is licensed under LGPLv2 or later.

* Moved from appveyor and travis to Github Actions for continuous integration.

What's New in astroid 2.5.3?
============================
Release date: 2021-04-10

* Takes into account the fact that subscript inferring for a ClassDef may involve __class_getitem__ method

* Reworks the ``collections`` and ``typing`` brain so that pylint`s acceptance tests are fine.

  Closes PyCQA/pylint#4206

* Use ``inference_tip`` for ``typing.TypedDict`` brain.

* Fix mro for classes that inherit from typing.Generic

* Add inference tip for typing.Generic and typing.Annotated with ``__class_getitem__``

* Remove the runtime dependency on ``six``. The ``six`` brain remains in
  astroid.

  Fixes PyCQA/astroid#863

* Enrich the ``brain_collection`` module so that ``__class_getitem__`` method is added to `deque` for
  ``python`` version above 3.9.

* The ``context.path`` is now a ``dict`` and the ``context.push`` method
  returns ``True`` if the node has been visited a certain amount of times.

  Close #669

* Adds a brain for type object so that it is possible to write `type[int]` in annotation.

  Fixes PyCQA/pylint#4001

* Add ``__class_getitem__`` method to ``subprocess.Popen`` brain under Python 3.9 so that it is seen as subscriptable by pylint.

  Fixes PyCQA/pylint#4034

* Fix a crash in inference caused by `Uninferable` container elements

  Close #866

* Add `python 3.9` support.

  Fixes PyCQA/pylint#3640

* Fix a bug for dunder methods inference of function objects

  Fixes #819

* Fixes a bug in the signature of the ``ndarray.__or__`` method,

* Prevent recursion error for self referential length calls

  Close #777

* Added missing methods to the brain for ``mechanize``, to fix pylint false positives

  Close #793

* Added more supported parameters to ``subprocess.check_output``

* Fix recursion errors with pandas

  Fixes PyCQA/pylint#2843
  Fixes PyCQA/pylint#2811

  Close PyCQA/pylint#3776

* Fix a crash caused by a lookup of a monkey-patched method

  Close PyCQA/pylint#3686

* ``is_generator`` correctly considers `Yield` nodes in `AugAssign` nodes

  This fixes a false positive with the `assignment-from-no-return` pylint check.

  Close PyCQA/pylint#3904

* Corrected the parent of function type comment nodes.

  These nodes used to be parented to their original ast.FunctionDef parent
  but are now correctly parented to their astroid.FunctionDef parent.

  Close PyCQA/astroid#851


What's New in astroid 2.4.2?
============================
Release date: 2020-06-08

* `FunctionDef.is_generator` properly handles `yield` nodes in `While` tests

  Close PyCQA/pylint#3519

* Properly construct the arguments of inferred property descriptors

  Close PyCQA/pylint#3648


What's New in astroid 2.4.1?
============================
Release date: 2020-05-05

* Handle the case where the raw builder fails to retrieve the ``__all__`` attribute

  Close #772

* Restructure the AST parsing heuristic to always pick the same module

What's New in astroid 2.4.0?
============================
Release date: 2020-04-27

* Expose a ast_from_string method in AstroidManager, which will accept
  source code as a string and return the corresponding astroid object

  Closes PyCQA/astroid#725

* ``BoundMethod.implicit_parameters`` returns a proper value for ``__new__``

  Close PyCQA/pylint#2335

  Close PyCQA/pylint#3417

* Prevent a recursion error to happen when inferring the declared metaclass of a class

  Close #749

* Raise ``AttributeInferenceError`` when ``getattr()`` receives an empty name

  Close PyCQA/pylint#2991

* Prevent a recursion error for self reference variables and `type()` calls.

  Close #199

* Do not infer the first argument of a staticmethod in a metaclass as the class itself

  Close PyCQA/pylint#3032

* ``NodeNG.bool_value()`` gained an optional ``context`` parameter

  We need to pass an inference context downstream when inferring the boolean
  value of a node in order to prevent recursion errors and double inference.

  This fix prevents a recursion error with dask library.

  Close PyCQA/pylint#2985

* Pass a context argument to ``astroid.Arguments`` to prevent recursion errors

  Close PyCQA/pylint#3414

* Better inference of class and static methods decorated with custom methods

  Close PyCQA/pylint#3209

* Reverse the order of decorators for `infer_subscript`

  `path_wrapper` needs to come first, followed by `raise_if_nothing_inferred`,
  otherwise we won't handle `StopIteration` correctly.

  Close #762

* Prevent a recursion error when inferring self-referential variables without definition

  Close PyCQA/pylint#1285

* Numpy `datetime64.astype` return value is inferred as a `ndarray`.

  Close PyCQA/pylint#3332

* Skip non ``Assign`` and ``AnnAssign`` nodes from enum reinterpretation

  Closes PyCQA/pylint#3365

* Numpy ``ndarray`` attributes ``imag`` and ``real`` are now inferred as ``ndarray``.

  Close PyCQA/pylint#3322

* Added a call to ``register_transform`` for all functions of the ``brain_numpy_core_multiarray``
  module in case the current node is an instance of ``astroid.Name``

  Close #666

* Use the parent of the node when inferring aug assign nodes instead of the statement

  Close PyCQA/pylint#2911
  Close PyCQA/pylint#3214

* Added some functions to the ``brain_numpy_core_umath`` module

  Close PyCQA/pylint#3319

* Added some functions of the ``numpy.core.multiarray`` module

  Close PyCQA/pylint#3208

* All the ``numpy ufunc`` functions derived now from a common class that
  implements the specific ``reduce``, ``accumulate``, ``reduceat``,
  ``outer`` and ``at`` methods.

  Close PyCQA/pylint#2885

* ``nodes.Const.itered`` returns a list of ``Const`` nodes, not strings

  Close PyCQA/pylint#3306

* The ``shape`` attribute of a ``numpy ndarray`` is now a ``ndarray``

  Close PyCQA/pylint#3139

* Don't ignore special methods when inspecting gi classes

  Close #728

* Added transform for ``scipy.gaussian``

* Add support for inferring properties.

* Added a brain for ``responses``

* Allow inferring positional only arguments.

* Retry parsing a module that has invalid type comments

  It is possible for a module to use comments that might be interpreted
  as type comments by the `ast` library. We do not want to completely crash on those
  invalid type comments.

  Close #708

* Scope the inference to the current bound node when inferring instances of classes

  When inferring instances of classes from arguments, such as ``self``
  in a bound method, we could use as a hint the context's ``boundnode``,
  which indicates the instance from which the inference originated.
  As an example, a subclass that uses a parent's method which returns
  ``self``, will override the ``self`` to point to it instead of pointing
  to the parent class.

  Close PyCQA/pylint#3157

* Add support for inferring exception instances in all contexts

  We were able to infer exception instances as ``ExceptionInstance``
  only for a handful of cases, but not all. ``ExceptionInstance`` has
  support for better inference of `.args` and other exception related
  attributes that normal instances do not have.
  This additional support should remove certain false positives related
  to ``.args`` and other exception attributes in ``pylint``.

  Close PyCQA/pylint#2333

* Add more supported parameters to ``subprocess.check_output``

  Close #722

* Infer args unpacking of ``self``

  Certain stdlib modules use ``*args`` to encapsulate
  the ``self`` parameter, which results in uninferable
  instances given we rely on the presence of the ``self``
  argument to figure out the instance where we should be
  setting attributes.

  Close PyCQA/pylint#3216

* Clean up setup.py

  Make pytest-runner a requirement only if running tests, similar to what was
  done with McCabe.

  Clean up the setup.py file, resolving a handful of minor warnings with it.

* Handle StopIteration error in infer_int.

  Close PyCQA/pylint#3274

* Can access per argument type comments for positional only and keyword only arguments.

  The comments are accessed through through the new
  ``Arguments.type_comment_posonlyargs`` and
  ``Arguments.type_comment_kwonlyargs`` attributes respectively.

* Relax upper bound on `wrapt`

  Close #755

* Properly analyze CFFI compiled extensions.

What's New in astroid 2.3.2?
============================
Release date: 2019-10-18

* All type comments have as parent the corresponding `astroid` node

  Until now they had as parent the builtin `ast` node which meant
  we were operating with primitive objects instead of our own.

  Close PyCQA/pylint#3174


* Pass an inference context to `metaclass()` when inferring an object type

  This should prevent a bunch of recursion errors happening in pylint.
  Also refactor the inference of `IfExp` nodes to use separate contexts
  for each potential branch.

  Close PyCQA/pylint#3152
  Close PyCQA/pylint#3159


What's New in astroid 2.3.1?
============================
Release date: 2019-09-30

* A transform for the builtin `dataclasses` module was added.

  This should address various `dataclasses` issues that were surfaced
  even more after the release of pylint 2.4.0.
  In the previous versions of `astroid`, annotated assign nodes were
  allowed to be retrieved via `getattr()` but that no longer happens
  with the latest `astroid` release, as those attribute are not actual
  attributes, but rather virtual ones, thus an operation such as `getattr()`
  does not make sense for them.

* Update attr brain to partly understand annotated attributes

  Close #656


What's New in astroid 2.3.0?
============================
Release date: 2019-09-24

* Add a brain tip for ``subprocess.check_output``

  Close #689

* Remove NodeNG.nearest method because of lack of usage in astroid and pylint.

  Close #691

* Allow importing wheel files. Close #541

* Annotated AST follows PEP8 coding style when converted to string.

* Fix a bug where defining a class using type() could cause a DuplicateBasesError.

  Close #644

* Dropped support for Python 3.4.

* Numpy brain support is improved.

  Numpy's fundamental type ``numpy.ndarray`` has its own brain : ``brain_numpy_ndarray`` and
  each numpy module that necessitates brain action has now its own numpy brain :

    - ``numpy.core.numeric``
    - ``numpy.core.function_base``
    - ``numpy.core.multiarray``
    - ``numpy.core.numeric``
    - ``numpy.core.numerictypes``
    - ``numpy.core.umath``
    - ``numpy.random.mtrand``

* ``assert`` only functions are properly inferred as returning ``None``

  Close #668

* Add support for Python 3.8's `NamedExpr` nodes, which is part of assignment expressions.

  Close #674

* Added support for inferring `IfExp` nodes.

* Instances of exceptions are inferred as such when inferring in non-exception context

  This allows special inference support for exception attributes such as `.args`.

  Close PyCQA/pylint#2333

* Drop a superfluous and wrong callcontext when inferring the result of a context manager

  Close PyCQA/pylint#2859

* ``igetattr`` raises ``InferenceError`` on re-inference of the same object

  This prevents ``StopIteration`` from leaking when we encounter the same
  object in the current context, which could result in various ``RuntimeErrors``
  leaking in other parts of the inference.
  Until we get a global context per inference, the solution is sort of a hack,
  as with the suggested global context improvement, we could theoretically
  reuse the same inference object.

  Close #663

* Variable annotations can no longer be retrieved with `ClassDef.getattr`

  Unless they have an attached value, class variable annotations can no longer
  be retrieved with `ClassDef.getattr.`

* Improved builtin inference for ``tuple``, ``set``, ``frozenset``, ``list`` and ``dict``

  We were properly inferring these callables *only* if they had consts as
  values, but that is not the case most of the time. Instead we try to infer
  the values that their arguments can be and use them instead of assuming
  Const nodes all the time.

  Close PyCQA/pylint#2841

* The last except handler wins when inferring variables bound in an except handler.

  Close PyCQA/pylint#2777


* ``threading.Lock.locked()`` is properly recognized as a member of ``threading.Lock``

  Close PyCQA/pylint#2791

What's New in astroid 2.1.0?
============================
Release date: 2018-11-25

   * ``threading.Lock.acquire`` has the ``timeout`` parameter now.

     Close PyCQA/pylint#2457

   * Pass parameters by keyword name when inferring sequences.

     Close PyCQA/pylint#2526

   * Correct line numbering for f-strings for complex embedded expressions

     When a f-string contained a complex expression, such as an attribute access,
     we weren't cloning all the subtree of the f-string expression for attaching the correct
     line number. This problem is coming from the builtin AST parser which gives for the f-string
     and for its underlying elements the line number 1, but this is causing all sorts of bugs and
     problems in pylint, which expects correct line numbering.

     Close PyCQA/pylint#2449

   * Add support for `argparse.Namespace`

     Close PyCQA/pylint#2413

   * `async` functions are now inferred as `AsyncGenerator` when inferring their call result.

   * Filter out ``Uninferable`` when inferring the call result result of a class with an uninferable ``__call__`` method.

     Close PyCQA/pylint#2434

   * Make compatible with AST changes in Python 3.8.

   * Subscript inference (e.g. "`a[i]`") now pays attention to multiple inferred values for value
     (e.g. "`a`") and slice (e.g. "`i`")

     Close #614

============================

Release date: 2018-08-01

   * Stop repeat inference attempt causing a RuntimeError in Python3.7

     Close PyCQA/pylint#2317

   *  infer_call_result can raise InferenceError so make sure to handle that for the call sites
      where it is used

     infer_call_result started recently to raise InferenceError for objects for which it
     could not find any returns. Previously it was silently raising a StopIteration,
     which was especially leaking when calling builtin methods.
     Since it is after all an inference method, it is expected that it
     could raise an InferenceError rather than returning nothing.

What's New in astroid 2.0.1?

   * AsStringRegexpPredicate has been removed.

     Use transform predicates instead of it.

   * Switched to using typed_ast for getting access to type comments

     As a side effect of this change, some nodes gained a new `type_annotation` attribute,
     which, if the type comments were correctly parsed, should contain a node object
     with the corresponding objects from the type comment.

   * typing.X[...] and typing.NewType are inferred as classes instead of instances.

   * Module.__path__ is now a list

     It used to be a string containing the path, but it doesn't reflect the situation
     on Python, where it is actually a list.

   * Don't raise DuplicateBaseError when classes at different locations are used

     For instance, one can implement a namedtuple base class, which gets reused
     on a class with the same name later on in the file. Until now, we considered
     these two classes as being the same, because they shared the name, but in fact
     they are different, being created at different locations and through different

What's New in astroid 1.5.3?
============================

Release date: 2017-06-03


    * enum34 dependency is forced to be at least version 1.1.3. Fixes spurious
      bug related to enum classes being falsy in boolean context, which caused
      ``_Inconsistent Hierarchy_`` ``RuntimeError`` in ``singledispatch`` module.

      See links below for details:
        - http://bugs.python.org/issue26748
        - https://bitbucket.org/ambv/singledispatch/issues/8/inconsistent-hierarchy-with-enum
        - https://bitbucket.org/stoneleaf/enum34/commits/da50803651ab644e6fce66ebc85562f1117c344b

    * Do not raise an exception when uninferable value is unpacked in ``with`` statement.

    * Lock objects from ``threading`` module are now correctly recognised
      as context managers.


What's New in astroid 1.5.2?
============================

Release date: 2017-04-17


   * Basic support for the class form of typing.NamedTuple

   * mro() can be computed for classes with old style classes in the hierarchy



What's New in astroid 1.5.0?
============================

Release date: 2017-04-13


    * Arguments node gained a new attribute, ``kwonlyargs_annotations``

      This new attribute holds the annotations for the keyword-only
      arguments.

    * `namedtuple` inference now understands `rename` keyword argument

    * Classes can now know their definition-time arguments.

      Classes can support keyword arguments, which are passed when
      a class is constructed using ``__new__``.

    * Add support for inferring typing.NamedTuple.

    * ClassDef now supports __getitem__ inference through the metaclass.

    * getitem() method accepts nodes now, instead of Python objects.

    * Add support for explicit namespace packages, created with pkg_resources.

    * Add brain tips for _io.TextIOWrapper's buffer and raw attributes.

    * Add `returns` into the proper order in FunctionDef._astroid_fields

      The order is important, since it determines the last child,
      which in turn determines the last line number of a scoped node.

    * Add brain tips for functools.lru_cache.

    * New function, astroid.extract_node, exported out from astroid.test_utils.

    * Stop saving assignment locals in ExceptHandlers, when the context is a store.

      This fixes a tripping case, where the RHS of a ExceptHandler can be redefined
      by the LHS, leading to a local save. For instance, ``except KeyError, exceptions.IndexError``
      could result in a local save for IndexError as KeyError, resulting in potential unexpected
      inferences. Since we don't lose a lot, this syntax gets prohibited.

    * Fix a crash which occurred when the class of a namedtuple could not be inferred.

    * Add support for implicit namespace packages (PEP 420)

      This change involves a couple of modifications. First, we're relying on a
      spec finder protocol, inspired by importlib's ModuleSpec, for finding where
      a file or package is, using importlib's PathFinder as well, which enable
      us to discover namespace packages as well.
      This discovery is the center piece of the namespace package support,
      the other part being the construction of a dummy Module node whenever
      a namespace package root directory is requested during astroid's import
      references.

    * Introduce a special attributes model

      Through this model, astroid starts knowing special attributes of certain Python objects,
      such as functions, classes, super objects and so on. This was previously possible before,
      but now the lookup and the attributes themselves are separated into a new module,
      objectmodel.py, which describes, in a more comprehensive way, the data model of each
      object.

    * Exceptions have their own object model

      Some of exceptions's attributes, such as .args and .message,
      can't be inferred correctly since they are descriptors that get
      transformed into the proper objects at runtime. This can cause issues
      with the static analysis, since they are inferred as different than
      what's expected. Now when we're creating instances of exceptions,
      we're inferring a special object that knows how to transform those
      runtime attributes into the proper objects via a custom object model.
      Closes issue #81

    * dict.values, dict.keys and dict.items are properly
      inferred to their corresponding type, which also
      includes the proper containers for Python 3.

    * Fix a crash which occurred when a method had a same name as a builtin object,
      decorated at the same time by that builtin object ( a property for instance)

    * The inference can handle the case where the attribute is accessed through a subclass
      of a base class and the attribute is defined at the base class's level,
      by taking in consideration a redefinition in the subclass.

      This should fix https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint/issues/432

    * Calling lambda methods (defined at class level) can be understood.

    * Don't take in consideration invalid assignments, especially when __slots__
      declaration forbids them.

      Close issue #332

    * Functional form of enums support accessing values through __call__.

    * Brain tips for the ssl library.

    * decoratornames() does not leak InferenceError anymore.

    * wildcard_imported_names() got replaced by _public_names()

      Our understanding of wildcard imports through __all__ was
      half baked to say at least, since we couldn't account for
      modifications of the list, which results in tons of false positives.
      Instead, we replaced it with _public_names(), a method which returns
      all the names that are publicly available in a module, that is that
      don't start with an underscore, even though this means that there
      is a possibility for other names to be leaked out even though
      they are not present in the __all__ variable.

      The method is private in 1.4.X.

    * unpack_infer raises InferenceError if it can't operate
      with the given sequences of nodes.

    * Support accessing properties with super().

    * Enforce strong updates per frames.

      When looking up a name in a scope, Scope.lookup will return
      only the values which will be reachable after execution, as seen
      in the following code:

           a = 1
           a = 2

      In this case it doesn't make sense to return two values, but
      only the last one.

    * Add support for inference on threading.Lock

      As a matter of fact, astroid can infer on threading.RLock,
      threading.Semaphore, but can't do it on threading.Lock (because it comes
      from an extension module).

    * pkg_resources brain tips are a bit more specific,
      by specifying proper returns.

    * The slots() method conflates all the slots from the ancestors
      into a list of current and parent slots.

      We're doing this because this is the right semantics of slots,
      they get inherited, as long as each parent defines a __slots__
      entry.

    * Some nodes got a new attribute, 'ctx', which tells in which context
      the said node was used.

      The possible values for the contexts are `Load` ('a'), `Del`
      ('del a'), `Store` ('a = 4') and the nodes that got the new
      attribute are Starred, Subscript, List and Tuple. Closes issue #267.

    * relative_to_absolute_name or methods calling it will now raise
      TooManyLevelsError when a relative import was trying to
      access something beyond the top-level package.

    * AstroidBuildingException is now AstroidBuildingError. The first
      name will exist until astroid 2.0.

    * Add two new exceptions, AstroidImportError and AstroidSyntaxError.
      They are subclasses of AstroidBuildingException and are raised when
      a module can't be imported from various reasons.
      Also do_import_module lets the errors to bubble up without converting
      them to InferenceError. This particular conversion happens only
      during the inference.

    * Revert to using printf-style formatting in as_string, in order
      to avoid a potential problem with encodings when using .format.
      Closes issue #273. Patch by notsqrt.

    * assigned_stmts methods have the same signature from now on.

      They used to have different signatures and each one made
      assumptions about what could be passed to other implementations,
      leading to various possible crashes when one or more arguments
      weren't given. Closes issue #277.

    * Fix metaclass detection, when multiple keyword arguments
      are used in class definition.

    * Add support for annotated variable assignments (PEP 526)

    * Starred expressions are now inferred correctly for tuple,
      list, set, and dictionary literals.

    * Support for asynchronous comprehensions introduced in Python 3.6.

      Fixes #399. See PEP530 for details.


What's New in astroid 1.4.1?
============================

Release date: 2015-11-29


    * Add support for handling Uninferable nodes when calling as_string

      Some object, for instance List or Tuple can have, after inference,
      Uninferable as their elements, happening when their components
      weren't couldn't be inferred properly. This means that as_string
      needs to cope with expecting Uninferable nodes part of the other
      nodes coming for a string transformation. The patch adds a visit
      method in AsString and ``accept`` on Yes / Uninferable nodes.
      Closes issue #270.



What's New in astroid 1.4.0?
============================

Release date: 2015-11-29


    * Class.getattr('__mro__') returns the actual MRO. Closes issue #128.

    * The logilab-common dependency is not needed anymore as the needed code
      was integrated into astroid.

    * Generated enum member stubs now support IntEnum and multiple
      base classes.

    * astroid.builder.AstroidBuilder.string_build and
      astroid.builder.AstroidBuilder.file_build are now raising
      AstroidBuildingException when the parsing of the string raises
      a SyntaxError.

    * Add brain tips for multiprocessing.Manager and
      multiprocessing.managers.SyncManager.

    * Add some fixes which enhances the Jython support.
      The fix mostly includes updates to modutils, which is
      modified in order to properly lookup paths from live objects,
      which ends in $py.class, not pyc as for Python 2,
      Closes issue #83.

    * The Generator objects inferred with `infer_call_result`
      from functions have as parent the function from which they
      are returned.

    * Add brain tips for multiprocessing post Python 3.4+,
      where the module level functions are retrieved with getattr
      from a context object, leading to many no-member errors
      in Pylint.

    * Understand partially the 3-argument form of `type`.
      The only change is that astroid understands members
      passed in as dictionaries as the third argument.

    * .slots() will return an empty list for classes with empty slots.
      Previously it returned None, which is the same value for
      classes without slots at all. This was changed in order
      to better reflect what's actually happening.

    * Improve the inference of Getattr nodes when dealing with
      abstract properties from the abc module.

      In astroid.bases.Instance._wrap_attr we had a detection
      code for properties, which basically inferred whatever
      a property returned, passing the results up the stack,
      to the igetattr() method. It handled only the builtin property
      but the new patch also handles a couple of other properties,
      such as abc.abstractproperty.

    * UnboundMethod.getattr calls the getattr of its _proxied object
      and doesn't call super(...) anymore.

      It previously crashed, since the first ancestor in its mro was
      bases.Proxy and bases.Proxy doesn't implement the .getattr method.
      Closes issue #91.

    * Don't hard fail when calling .mro() on a class which has
      combined both newstyle and old style classes. The class
      in question is actually newstyle (and the __mro__ can be
      retrieved using Python).

      .mro() fallbacks to using .ancestors() in that case.

    * Class.local_attr and Class.local_attr_ancestors uses internally
      a mro lookup, using .mro() method, if they can.

      That means for newstyle classes, when trying to lookup a member
      using one of these functions, the first one according to the
      mro will be returned. This reflects nicely the reality,
      but it can have as a drawback the fact that it is a behaviour
      change (the previous behaviour was incorrect though). Also,
      having bases which can return multiple values when inferred
      will not work with the new approach, because .mro() only
      retrieves the first value inferred from a base.

    * Expose an implicit_metaclass() method in Class. This will return
      a builtins.type instance for newstyle classes.

    * Add two new exceptions for handling MRO error cases. DuplicateBasesError
      is emitted when duplicate bases are found in a class,
      InconsistentMroError is raised when the method resolution is determined
      to be inconsistent. They share a common class, MroError, which
      is a subclass of ResolveError, meaning that this change is backwards
      compatible.

    * Classes aren't marked as interfaces anymore, in the `type` attribute.

    * Class.has_dynamic_getattr doesn't return True for special methods
      which aren't implemented in pure Python, as it is the case for extension modules.

      Since most likely the methods were coming from a live object, this implies
      that all of them will have __getattr__ and __getattribute__ present and it
      is wrong to consider that those methods were actually implemented.

    * Add basic support for understanding context managers.

      Currently, there's no way to understand whatever __enter__ returns in a
      context manager and what it is bound using the ``as`` keyword. With these changes,
      we can understand ``bar`` in ``with foo() as bar``, which will be the result of __enter__.

    * Add a new type of node, called *inference objects*. Inference objects are similar with
      AST nodes, but they can be obtained only after inference, so they can't be found
      inside the original AST tree. Their purpose is to handle at astroid level
      some operations which can't be handled when using brain transforms.
      For instance, the first object added is FrozenSet, which can be manipulated
      at astroid's level (inferred, itered etc). Code such as this 'frozenset((1,2))'
      will not return an Instance of frozenset, without having access to its
      content, but a new objects.FrozenSet, which can be used just as a nodes.Set.

    * Add a new *inference object* called Super, which also adds support for understanding
      super calls. astroid understands the zero-argument form of super, specific to
      Python 3, where the interpreter fills itself the arguments of the call. Also, we
      are understanding the 2-argument form of super, both for bounded lookups
      (super(X, instance)) as well as for unbounded lookups (super(X, Y)),
      having as well support for validating that the object-or-type is a subtype
      of the first argument. The unbounded form of super (one argument) is not
      understood, since it's useless in practice and should be removed from
      Python's specification. Closes issue #89.

    * Add inference support for getattr builtin. Now getattr builtins are
      properly understood. Closes issue #103.

    * Add inference support for hasattr builtin. Closes issue #102.

    * Add 'assert_equals' method in nose.tools's brain plugin.

    * Don't leak StopIteration when inferring invalid UnaryOps (+[], +None etc.).

    * Improve the inference of UnaryOperands.

      When inferring unary operands, astroid looks up the return value
      of __pos__, __neg__ and __invert__ to determine the inferred value
      of ``~node``, ``+node`` or ``-node``.

    * Improve the inference of six.moves, especially when using `from ... import ...`
      syntax. Also, we added a new fail import hook for six.moves, which fixes the
      import-error false positive from pylint. Closes issue #107.

    * Make the first steps towards detecting type errors for unary and binary
      operations.

      In exceptions, one object was added for holding information about a possible
      UnaryOp TypeError, object called `UnaryOperationError`. Even though the name
      suggests it's an exception, it's actually not one. When inferring UnaryOps,
      we use this special object to mark a possible TypeError,
      object which can be interpreted by pylint in order to emit a new warning.
      We are also exposing a new method for UnaryOps, called `type_errors`,
      which returns a list of UnaryOperationsError.

    * A new method was added to the AST nodes, 'bool_value'. It is used to deduce
      the value of a node when used in a boolean context, which is useful
      for both inference, as well as for data flow analysis, where we are interested
      in what branches will be followed when the program will be executed.
      `bool_value` returns True, False or YES, if the node's boolean value can't
      be deduced. The method is used when inferring the unary operand `not`.
      Thus, `not something` will result in calling `something.bool_value` and
      negating the result, if it is a boolean.

    * Add inference support for boolean operations (`and` and `not`).

    * Add inference support for the builtin `callable`.

    * astroid.inspector was moved to pylint.pyreverse, since
      it is the only known client of this module. No other change
      was made to the exported API.

    * astroid.utils.ASTWalker and astroid.utils.LocalsVisitor
      were moved to pylint.pyreverse.utils.

    * Add inference support for the builtin `bool`.

    * Add `igetattr` method to scoped_nodes.Function.

    * Add support for Python 3.5's MatMul operation: see PEP 465 for more
      details.

    * NotImplemented is detected properly now as being part of the
      builtins module. Previously trying to infer the Name(NotImplemented)
      returned an YES object.

    * Add astroid.helpers, a module of various useful utilities which don't
      belong yet into other components. Added *object_type*, a function
      which can be used to obtain the type of almost any astroid object,
      similar to how the builtin *type* works.

    * Understand the one-argument form of the builtin *type*.

      This uses the recently added *astroid.helpers.object_type* in order to
      retrieve the Python type of the first argument of the call.

    * Add helpers.is_supertype and helpers.is_subtype, two functions for
      checking if an object is a super/sub type of another.

    * Improve the inference of binary arithmetic operations (normal
      and augmented).

    * Add support for retrieving TypeErrors for binary arithmetic operations.

      The change is similar to what was added for UnaryOps: a new method
      called *type_errors* for both AugAssign and BinOp, which can be used
      to retrieve type errors occurred during inference. Also, a new
      exception object was added, BinaryOperationError.

    * Lambdas found at class level, which have a `self` argument, are considered
      BoundMethods when accessing them from instances of their class.

    * Add support for multiplication of tuples and lists with instances
      which provides an __index__ returning-int method.

    * Add support for indexing containers with instances which provides
      an __index__ returning-int method.

    * Star unpacking in assignments returns properly a list,
      not the individual components. Closes issue #138.

    * Add annotation support for function.as_string(). Closes issue #37.

    * Add support for indexing bytes on Python 3.

    * Add support for inferring subscript on instances, which will
      use __getitem__. Closes issue #124.

    * Add support for pkg_resources.declare_namespaces.

    * Move pyreverse specific modules and functionality back into pyreverse
      (astroid.manager.Project, astroid.manager.Manager.project_from_files).

    * Understand metaclasses added with six.add_metaclass decorator. Closes issue #129.

    * Add a new convenience API, `astroid.parse`, which can be used to retrieve
      an astroid AST from a source code string, similar to how ast.parse can be
      used to obtain a Python AST from a source string. This is the test_utils.build_module
      promoted to a public API.

    * do_import_module passes the proper relative_only flag if the level is higher
      than 1. This has the side effect that using `from .something import something`
      in a non-package will finally result in an import-error on Pylint's side.
      Until now relative_only was ignored, leading to the import of `something`,
      if it was globally available.

    * Add get_wrapping_class API to scoped_nodes, which can be used to
      retrieve the class that wraps a node.

    * Class.getattr looks by default in the implicit and the explicit metaclasses,
      which is `type` on Python 3.

      Closes issue #114.

    * There's a new separate step for transforms.

      Until now, the transforms were applied at the same time the tree was
      being built. This was problematic if the transform functions were
      using inference, since the inference was executed on a partially
      constructed tree, which led to failures when post-building
      information was needed (such as setting the _from_names
      for the From imports).
      Now there's a separate step for transforms, which are applied
      using transform.TransformVisitor.
      There's a couple of other related changes:

          * astroid.parse and AstroidBuilder gained a new parameter
            `apply_transforms`, which is a boolean flag, which will
            control if the transforms are applied. We do this because
            there are uses when the vanilla tree is wanted, without
            any implicit modification.

          * the transforms are also applied for builtin modules,
            as a side effect of the fact that transform visiting
            was moved in AstroidBuilder._post_build from
            AstroidBuilder._data_build.

      Closes issue #116.

    * Class._explicit_metaclass is now a public API, in the form of
      Class.declared_metaclass.

      Class.mro remains the de facto method for retrieving the metaclass
      of a class, which will also do an evaluation of what declared_metaclass
      returns.

    * Understand slices of tuples, lists, strings and instances with support
      for slices.

      Closes issue #137.

    * Add proper grammatical names for `inferred` and `ass_type` methods,
      namely `inferred` and `assign_type`.

      The old methods will raise PendingDeprecationWarning, being slated
      for removal in astroid 2.0.

    * Add new AST names in order to be similar to the ones
      from the builtin ast module.

      With this change, Getattr becomes Attributes, Backquote becomes
      Repr, Class is ClassDef, Function is FunctionDef,  Discard is Expr,
      CallFunc is Call, From is ImportFrom, AssName is AssignName
      and AssAttr is AssignAttr. The old names are maintained for backwards
      compatibility and they are interchangeable, in the sense that using
      Discard will use Expr under the hood and the implemented visit_discard
      in checkers will be called with Expr nodes instead. The AST does not
      contain the old nodes, only the interoperability between them hides this
      fact. Recommendations to move to the new nodes are emitted accordingly,
      the old names will be removed in astroid 2.0.

    * Add support for understanding class creation using `type.__new__(mcs, name, bases, attrs)``

      Until now, inferring this kind of calls resulted in Instances, not in classes,
      since astroid didn't understand that the presence of the metaclass in the call
      leads to a class creating, not to an instance creation.

    * Understand the `slice` builtin. Closes issue #184.

    * Add brain tips for numpy.core, which should fix Pylint's #453.

    * Add a new node, DictUnpack, which is used to represent the unpacking
      of a dictionary into another dictionary, using PEP 448 specific syntax
      ``({1:2, **{2:3})``

      This is a different approach than what the builtin ast module does,
      since it just uses None to represent this kind of operation,
      which seems conceptually wrong, due to the fact the AST contains
      non-AST nodes. Closes issue #206.




What's New in astroid 1.3.6?
============================

Release date: 2015-03-14


    * Class.slots raises NotImplementedError for old style classes.
      Closes issue #67.

    * Add a new option to AstroidManager, `optimize_ast`, which
      controls if peephole optimizer should be enabled or not.
      This prevents a regression, where the visit_binop method
      wasn't called anymore with astroid 1.3.5, due to the differences
      in the resulting AST. Closes issue #82.



What's New in astroid 1.3.5?
============================

Release date: 2015-03-11


    * Add the ability to optimize small ast subtrees,
      with the first use in the optimization of multiple
      BinOp nodes. This removes recursivity in the rebuilder
      when dealing with a lot of small strings joined by the
      addition operator. Closes issue #59.

    * Obtain the methods for the nose brain tip through an
      unittest.TestCase instance. Closes Pylint issue #457.

    * Fix a crash which occurred when a class was the ancestor
      of itself. Closes issue #78.

    * Improve the scope_lookup method for Classes regarding qualified
      objects, with an attribute name exactly as one provided in the
      class itself.

      For example, a class containing an attribute 'first',
      which was also an import and which had, as a base, a qualified name
      or a Gettattr node, in the form 'module.first', then Pylint would
      have inferred the `first` name as the function from the Class,
      not the import. Closes Pylint issue #466.

    * Implement the assigned_stmts operation for Starred nodes,
      which was omitted when support for Python 3 was added in astroid.
      Closes issue #36.



What's New in astroid 1.3.4?
============================

Release date: 2015-01-17


    * Get the first element from the method list when obtaining
      the functions from nose.tools.trivial. Closes Pylint issue #448.


What's New in astroid 1.3.3?
============================

Release date: 2015-01-16


    * Restore file_stream to a property, but deprecate it in favour of
      the newly added method Module.stream. By using a method instead of a
      property, it will be easier to properly close the file right
      after it is used, which will ensure that no file descriptors are
      leaked. Until now, due to the fact that a module was cached,
      it was not possible to close the file_stream anywhere.
      file_stream will start emitting PendingDeprecationWarnings in
      astroid 1.4, DeprecationWarnings in astroid 1.5 and it will
      be finally removed in astroid 1.6.

    * Add inference tips for 'tuple', 'list', 'dict' and 'set' builtins.

    * Add brain definition for most string and unicode methods

    * Changed the API for Class.slots. It returns None when the class
      doesn't define any slots. Previously, for both the cases where
      the class didn't have slots defined and when it had an empty list
      of slots, Class.slots returned an empty list.

    * Add a new method to Class nodes, 'mro', for obtaining the
      the method resolution order of the class.

    * Add brain tips for six.moves. Closes issue #63.

    * Improve the detection for functions decorated with decorators
      which returns static or class methods.

    * .slots() can contain unicode strings on Python 2.

    * Add inference tips for nose.tools.



What's New in astroid 1.3.2?
============================

Release date: 2014-11-22


    * Fixed a crash with invalid subscript index.

    * Implement proper base class semantics for Python 3, where
      every class derives from object.

    * Allow more fine-grained control over C extension loading
      in the manager.


What's New in astroid 1.3.1?
============================

Release date: 2014-11-21


    * Fixed a crash issue with the pytest brain module.


What's New in astroid 1.3.0?
============================

Release date: 2014-11-20


    * Fix a maximum recursion error occurred during the inference,
      where statements with the same name weren't filtered properly.
      Closes pylint issue #295.

    * Check that EmptyNode has an underlying object in
      EmptyNode.has_underlying_object.

    * Simplify the understanding of enum members.

    * Fix an infinite loop with decorator call chain inference,
      where the decorator returns itself. Closes issue #50.

    * Various speed improvements. Patch by Alex Munroe.

    * Add pytest brain plugin. Patch by Robbie Coomber.

    * Support for Python versions < 2.7 has been dropped, and the
      source has been made compatible with Python 2 and 3. Running
      2to3 on installation for Python 3 is not needed anymore.

    * astroid now depends on six.

    * modutils._module_file opens __init__.py in binary mode.
      Closes issues #51 and #13.

    * Only C extensions from trusted sources (the standard library)
      are loaded into the examining Python process to build an AST
      from the live module.

    * Path names on case-insensitive filesystems are now properly
      handled. This fixes the stdlib detection code on Windows.

    * Metaclass-generating functions like six.with_metaclass
      are now supported via some explicit detection code.

    * astroid.register_module_extender has been added to generalize
      the support for module extenders as used by many brain plugins.

    * brain plugins can now register hooks to handle failed imports,
      as done by the gobject-introspection plugin.

    * The modules have been moved to a separate package directory,
      `setup.py develop` now works correctly.



What's New in astroid 1.2.1?
============================

Release date: 2014-08-24


    * Fix a crash occurred when inferring decorator call chain.
      Closes issue #42.

    * Set the parent of vararg and kwarg nodes when inferring them.
      Closes issue #43.

    * namedtuple inference knows about '_fields' attribute.

    * enum members knows about the methods from the enum class.

    * Name inference will lookup in the parent function
      of the current scope, in case searching in the current scope
      fails.

    * Inference of the functional form of the enums takes into
      consideration the various inputs that enums accepts.

    * The inference engine handles binary operations (add, mul etc.)
      between instances.

    * Fix an infinite loop in the inference, by returning a copy
      of instance attributes, when calling 'instance_attr'.
      Closes issue #34 (patch by Emile Anclin).

    * Don't crash when trying to infer unbound object.__new__ call.
      Closes issue #11.


What's New in astroid 1.2.0?
============================

Release date: 2014-07-25


    * Function nodes can detect decorator call chain and see if they are
      decorated with builtin descriptors (`classmethod` and `staticmethod`).

    * infer_call_result called on a subtype of the builtin type will now
      return a new `Class` rather than an `Instance`.

    * `Class.metaclass()` now handles module-level __metaclass__ declaration
      on python 2, and no longer looks at the __metaclass__ class attribute on
      python 3.

    * Function nodes can detect if they are decorated with subclasses
      of builtin descriptors when determining their type
      (`classmethod` and `staticmethod`).

    * Add `slots` method to `Class` nodes, for retrieving
      the list of valid slots it defines.

    * Expose function annotation to astroid: `Arguments` node
      exposes 'varargannotation', 'kwargannotation' and 'annotations'
      attributes, while `Function` node has the 'returns' attribute.

    * Backported most of the logilab.common.modutils module there, as
      most things there are for pylint/astroid only and we want to be
      able to fix them without requiring a new logilab.common release

    * Fix names grabbed using wildcard import in "absolute import mode"
      (ie with absolute_import activated from the __future__ or with
      python 3). Fix pylint issue #58.

    * Add support in pylint-brain for understanding enum classes.


What's New in astroid 1.1.1?
============================

Release date: 2014-04-30

    * `Class.metaclass()` looks in ancestors when the current class
      does not define explicitly a metaclass.

    * Do not cache modules if a module with the same qname is already
      known, and only return cached modules if both name and filepath
      match. Fixes pylint Bitbucket issue #136.


What's New in astroid 1.1.0?
============================

Release date: 2014-04-18

    * All class nodes are marked as new style classes for Py3k.

    * Add a `metaclass` function to `Class` nodes to
      retrieve their metaclass.

    * Add a new YieldFrom node.

    * Add support for inferring arguments to namedtuple invocations.

    * Make sure that objects returned for namedtuple
      inference have parents.

    * Don't crash when inferring nodes from `with` clauses
      with multiple context managers. Closes #18.

    * Don't crash when a class has some __call__ method that is not
      inferable. Closes #17.

    * Unwrap instances found in `.ancestors()`, by using their _proxied
      class.




What's New in astroid 1.0.1?
============================

Release date: 2013-10-18

    * fix py3k/windows installation issue (issue #4)

    * fix bug with namedtuple inference (issue #3)

    * get back gobject introspection from pylint-brain

    * fix some test failures under pypy and py3.3, though there is one remaining
      in each of these platform (2.7 tests are all green)




What's New in astroid 1.0.0?
=============================

Release date: 2013-07-29

    * Fix some omissions in py2stdlib's version of hashlib and
      add a small test for it.

    * Properly recognize methods annotated with abc.abstract{property,method}
      as abstract.

    * Allow transformation functions on any node, providing a
      ``register_transform`` function on the manager instead of the
      ``register_transformer`` to make it more flexible wrt node selection

    * Use the new transformation API to provide support for namedtuple
      (actually in pylint-brain, closes #8766)

    * Added the test_utils module for building ASTs and
      extracting deeply nested nodes for easier testing.

    * Add support for py3k's keyword only arguments (PEP 3102)

    * RENAME THE PROJECT to astroid




What's New in astroid 0.24.3?

      .file_stream as a Module property opening the file only when needed

    * Lambda nodes should have a `name` attribute

    * only call transformers if modname specified




What's New in astroid 0.23.0?
=============================

Release date: 2011-10-07

    * #77187: ancestor() only returns the first class when inheriting
      from two classes coming from the same module

    * #76159: putting module's parent directory on the path causes problems
      linting when file names clash

    * #74746: should return empty module when __main__ is imported (patch by
      google)

      as argument




What's New in astroid 0.22.0?
=============================

Release date: 2011-07-18

    * added column offset information on nodes (patch by fawce)

    * fix #8847: pylint doesn't understand function attributes at all

    * fix #8774: iterator / generator / next method

    * fix bad building of ast from living object w/ container classes

    * somewhat fix #57299 and other similar issue: Exception when
      trying to validate file using PyQt's PyQt4.QtCore module: we can't

      released in logilab-common 0.12).
